************* RUN THE PROGRAM *************
Input: The user has to run the main() program and then enter the name of input file with .txt format
********************************************

Output: The program will generate the .ppm output file including the following format:
P3
# any comments you want to include
width height
255
r(0,0) g(0,0) b(0,0) r(1,0) g(1,0) b(1,0) r(2,0) g(2,0) b(2,0) ...
*************************************************************

Description:
You can run  the program by running the main() function. The program reads an image description (consisting of the image height and image width) from a text file
and generates an output image. The name of the output image should be automatically defined to be the same as
the name of the input file, except using the suffix .ppm instead of the suffix .txt.

The output image has some texture as being implemented in the code such that for the pixels that are
divisors of 7, the pixel color is set to green and for the rest of the pixels, the color is red.
This will generate an image with polka dot texture.

The Color class includes the r,g,b variable for each pixel
*************************************************************

Error Handling: Different failure scenarios have been included in the code as described in the
description of the assignment in order to gracefully handles unexpected input.
